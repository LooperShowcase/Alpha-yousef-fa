      <h1>Lamborghini</h1>
      <p>
        Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate,
        founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with
        Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel
        drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but
        sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and
        the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973,
        including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took
        control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group
        Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998,
        Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where
        it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New
        products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and
        brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand.
        In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the
        subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50
        per cent. Lamborghini currently produces the V10-powered Huracán, Urus
        SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine and will produce the Revuelto, a
        V12/electric hybrid, as of 2024. In addition, the company produces V12
        engines for offshore powerboat racing.
